- p: <p>Linear algebra is about linear combinations. That is, using arithmetic on columns of numbers called vectors and arrays of numbers called matrices, to create new columns and arrays of numbers. Linear algebra is the study of lines and planes, vector spaces and mappings that are required for linear transforms.</p>
- p: <p>The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the basic theoretical concepts of linear algebra as well as how to use and implement them in a suitable software platform. Familiarity with the concepts of this lesson provides the possibility of analyzing mappings and linear systems through matrices and actions, operators and defined concepts related to them. Similarly, the optimization problem is investigated as one of the most used applications of linear algebra.</p>
