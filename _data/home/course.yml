- p: <p>The term “numerical computations” refers to the use of computers to solve problems involving real numbers. Many real numbers can be expressed by a finite string of digits.</p>
- p: <p>The purpose of this course is to familiarize undergraduate students with numerical methods for solving scientific problems in various fields of science and engineering. These methods can estimate the scientific problems of different fields that cannot be accurately calculated with the usual mathematical methods, approximately and with a limited error. In some cases, it is possible to calculate the exact answer of the problems with the usual mathematical methods, but it has a high complexity. This complexity itself causes some errors. Numerical methods can estimate the answer of these problems with limited error and less complexity. Therefore, at the beginning of this course, students will be familiar with the concepts related to error, and then with different numerical methods to solve technical engineering problems. On the other hand, using efficient software environments to solve problems, comparing numerical methods and graphically displaying the results to summarize and summarize them are other goals of this course. Also, introducing students to the problems of the world that are impossible to solve with the usual mathematical methods or have a very high complexity, but numerical methods are provided to solve them effectively, can play a significant role in the practical education of this course.</p>
